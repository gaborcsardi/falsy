\description{
We define a set of objects as \sQuote{falsy}. Every other values are
\sQuote{truthy}. This is inspired by other scripting languages like
Python and Ruby. See the \code{\%||\%} and the \code{\%&&\%} operators
on how to write concise conditional code using truthy and falsy values.

See \code{\link{is_falsy}} for the definition of what is \emph{falsy}
and what is \emph{truthy}.
